          <h3>What this course covers</h3>
          <p>
            TAS2O is a hands-on Grade 10 course that builds on earlier technology learning. Students continue to use the
            engineering design process, but they work with more complex problems and stronger project expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, learners design and safely create prototypes, products, and/or services using tools and
            technologies from different industries. As they work, they apply precision measurement and follow clear
            health and safety standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, TAS2O supports career exploration. Therefore, students begin to understand job skills programs,
            education pathways, and skilled trades options that can lead to many careers.

          <h3>How learning happens in TAS2O</h3>
          <p>
            TAS2O uses project-based learning so students practise real skills. For example, learners plan workflows,
            build prototypes, test results, and then improve designs through iteration.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, students learn through discussion and teamwork. Therefore, they strengthen communication,
            project management, and workplace-style collaboration.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Direct instruction and teacher-facilitated class activities</li>
            <li>Experiential learning (learn by doing)</li>
            <li>Class discussion, small-group discussion, and partner conferencing</li>
            <li>Worksheets/surveys, brainstorming, and inquiry-based research</li>
            <li>Independent work and group work with guidance</li>
            <li>Use of computers/Internet where appropriate</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Assessment & Evaluation -->

      <div class="unit-content">
        <div class="content-inner">
          <h3>How grades are calculated</h3>
          <p>
            The primary purpose of assessment is to improve learning. Therefore, students receive feedback and coaching
            throughout projects, and they use success criteria to understand what quality work looks like.
          </p>
          <p>
            Evaluation is based on evidence from <strong>products</strong>, <strong>observations</strong>, and
            <strong>conversations</strong>. In addition, the course applies the Ontario achievement chart categories.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Category weighting:</strong> Knowledge &amp; Understanding (20%), Thinking (30%), Communication
              (20%), Application (30%)</li>
            <li><strong>Term work:</strong> 70% (course evaluations across Strand A and Strand B)</li>
            <li><strong>Final evaluation:</strong> 30% (end-of-course summative evaluation)</li>
            <li><strong>Provincial standard:</strong> Level 3 (70–79%)</li>

        <div class="content-inner">
          <h3>Advanced learning focus in TAS2O</h3>
          <p>
            TAS2O builds on the foundation of TAS1O, so students take more ownership of planning and problem solving.
            As a result, projects can be more complex, innovative, and independent.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, learning is embedded in authentic contexts. Therefore, students explore sustainability,
            efficiency, ergonomics, and innovation while designing solutions for real-world needs.
          </p>

          <h3>Support for learners</h3>
          <p>
            Teachers use inclusive strategies such as visuals, diagrams, modeling, and structured teamwork.
            For ESL/ELD learners, pre-teaching technical vocabulary and peer mentoring are also helpful.
          </p>
          <p>
            For students with special education needs, accommodations may include scaffolding, extended timelines, or
            adaptive tools. At the same time, expectations remain high and goals remain clear.
          </p>

          <h3>Health and safety</h3>
          <p>
            Safety is essential in TAS2O. Therefore, students are responsible for advanced safety practices, including
            tool operation, workshop procedures, and digital equipment safety.
