Below is a final, step-by-step SEO boost plan based on everything you shared (Yoast settings, Search Console, Core Web Vitals, WooCommerce/Elementor setup, sitemaps, robots.txt, and the fact that Google is showing mostly Product snippets).

I’m splitting it into: What’s not correct → Why it matters → Exact fix steps. This is the safest path to real organic growth.

⸻

A) What’s NOT correct right now (the real blockers)

1) CLS is extremely poor (0.72 desktop) on 116 URLs

What’s wrong: your pages (mostly /product/ pages) are shifting/jumping while loading.
Why it hurts: bad user experience + conversion drop + can contribute to weaker rankings and slower growth.
Why it happens on your site: Elementor + WooCommerce template + late loading elements (images/headers/fonts/widgets/cookie banner/chat) + aggressive JS delay can cause layout to render “late” and shift.

✅ Fix goal: CLS < 0.1 (good), ideally < 0.05.

⸻

2) LCP needs improvement on important pages (10 URLs)

What’s wrong: your main content paints too late.
Why it hurts: slower perceived load → worse engagement; can affect performance signals and user behavior.
Likely cause: heavy hero images, fonts, scripts, Elementor sections, caching optimization mis-config.

✅ Fix goal: LCP < 2.5s (desktop), ideally ~1.8s.

⸻

3) You have bad sitemap submissions in Search Console

What’s wrong: /sitemap and /sitemap/ are erroring; only /sitemap_index.xml is correct.
Why it matters: doesn’t kill SEO, but it creates crawl/reporting noise and confusion.

⸻

4) Yoast is currently allowing template pages to be indexed (Elementor Header/Footer Builder)

What’s wrong: Elementor templates are indexable (you showed it ON).
Why it hurts: Google indexes thin/duplicate pages → quality dilution/index bloat.

⸻

5) Google is seeing your content mainly as “Product snippets”

What’s happening: Search Console “Search appearance” shows a lot of Product snippets.
Why it matters: for education/school queries, Google often prefers service/location landing pages over “product style” pages unless the product pages are written like real informational pages.

This is why you can have 34.4K impressions and still CTR 1.2% (low): you’re being shown, but your snippet and/or page intent isn’t winning clicks.

⸻

B) What to do (final plan to boost SEO)

Step 1 — Clean the indexing + remove junk (safe, high impact)

1) Fix sitemaps in GSC (5 minutes)
	•	Search Console → Sitemaps
	•	Remove:
	•	/sitemap
	•	/sitemap/
	•	Keep only:
	•	✅ /sitemap_index.xml

Why this helps: clean crawling signals + clean reporting.

2) Yoast: stop indexing template/low-value pages (30 minutes)

In Yoast → Settings → Content types / Categories & tags:

✅ Turn OFF (noindex):
	•	Elementor Header & Footer Builder (must)
	•	Media/Attachment pages (recommended)
	•	Tags (recommended)
	•	Author archives (if not multi-author content site)
	•	Date archives
	•	Brands (unless you run a real product store and curate brand pages)

✅ Keep ON (index):
	•	Pages
	•	Posts only if you publish consistently (2-4/month); otherwise turn off and focus on pages.
	•	Categories only if you curate and keep limited.

Why this helps: stops index bloat and pushes Google to focus on your best pages.

⸻

Step 2 — Fix Core Web Vitals (this will “unlock” growth)

This is the most important technical step.

A) Fix CLS for /product/ pages (WooCommerce product template)

Do these in order:
	1.	Reserve space for the hero / top section

	•	Elementor: set a min-height for the hero section for desktop/tablet/mobile.
	•	Avoid “auto height” if content loads late.

	2.	Fix product image/gallery layout

	•	Ensure image container has fixed ratio.
	•	Make featured images consistent dimension ratio.

	3.	Stop layout shifts from late widgets

	•	CookieYes banner must be overlay bottom, not pushing content down.
	•	Avoid top bars that appear after load unless you reserve space.
	•	Chat bubble usually fine, but if it loads as a big container first, fix its initial size.

	4.	WP Rocket caution

	•	If “Delay JS execution” delays Elementor/slider/header scripts, layout loads late and shifts.
	•	Exclude from delay (typical examples):
	•	elementor
	•	elementor-frontend
	•	woocommerce
	•	slider scripts (swiper, slick)
	•	menu/header scripts

✅ Why this boosts SEO: better UX + higher engagement + higher conversion + removes a major quality/experience penalty.

B) Fix LCP on key pages
	1.	Optimize the hero/LCP image:

	•	Convert to WebP
	•	Correct size (don’t use 4000px images for a 1400px hero)
	•	Preload that image (WP Rocket or manual preload)

	2.	Simplify fonts:

	•	Fewer font weights
	•	Prefer locally hosted fonts if possible
	•	Don’t load multiple font families if not needed

	3.	Reduce above-the-fold scripts:

	•	Defer non-critical scripts
	•	Don’t delay scripts that build layout

✅ Why this boosts SEO: faster perceived load increases dwell time and lowers bounce. Google also sees improved CWV.

⸻

Step 3 — Increase CTR (fastest way to get more clicks)

You’re at Avg position ~10 with 1.2% CTR. That’s a big opportunity.

What to do (1-2 hours)

Search Console → Performance → Pages → sort by impressions (last 3 months)

For the top 10 pages:
	•	Rewrite SEO title to be Service + City + Brand
	•	Rewrite meta description to include:
	•	outcome/benefit
	•	trust cue (Ontario credits, private school, etc.)
	•	CTA

Example titles:
	•	Ontario High School Credits in Brampton | CanSTEM Education
	•	Private School in Brampton, Ontario | CanSTEM Education
	•	OUAC & OCAS Support in Brampton | CanSTEM Education

Example meta style:
	•	Earn Ontario credits with flexible online or in-person options in Brampton. Get support for OUAC/OCAS and graduation requirements. Contact CanSTEM to enroll.

✅ Why this instantly boosts SEO: CTR improvements can increase traffic immediately because you’re already getting impressions.

⸻

Step 4 — Fix the “Product page vs Service page” mismatch (ranking booster)

Right now a lot of visibility is tied to /product/ pages. For school SEO, you need proper landing pages too.

Create/upgrade these core pages (high ROI)
	1.	Private School in Brampton
	2.	Ontario Credits / High School Credits in Brampton
	3.	Tutoring in Brampton
	4.	Admissions
	5.	Student Services (OSSD / OUAC / OCAS)

Each page must include:
	•	clear H1 with keyword + location
	•	800-1500 words helpful content (not filler)
	•	FAQs (real)
	•	internal links to related pages
	•	local proof (address/phone/map on at least key pages)

✅ Why this boosts SEO: Google matches “service intent” better than product intent for education queries.

⸻

Step 5 — Local SEO (to rank top in Brampton)
	1.	Fully optimize Google Business Profile:

	•	correct category
	•	services
	•	weekly posts
	•	new photos regularly
	•	Q&A
	•	reviews continuously

	2.	Consistent NAP (name/address/phone) across site and directories.

✅ Why this boosts SEO: local pack + maps visibility drives high-intent traffic.

⸻

Step 6 — Updates & stability (important for performance + security)

You have many pending updates (WooCommerce, Stripe, WP Rocket, Yoast, CookieYes, Site Kit, Elementor addons).

✅ Best practice:
	•	update on staging / backup first
	•	re-check header/footer + checkout + product pages after

Why this helps SEO: fewer conflicts, fewer performance regressions, fewer schema/render issues.

⸻

C) The “instant boost” items (quick wins you’ll feel fastest)

If you want the fastest visible improvements, do these first:
	1.	✅ Remove bad sitemaps (/sitemap and /sitemap/)
	2.	✅ Noindex Elementor Header/Footer templates
	3.	✅ Fix CLS on /product/ template (reserve hero + image sizing)
	4.	✅ Rewrite titles/meta for top impression pages (CTR boost)
	5.	✅ Create/upgrade “Private School / Credits / Tutoring in Brampton” landing pages

⸻

D) One more important point from your latest screenshot (Google for WooCommerce / Marketing)

That dashboard suggests you’re using Google for WooCommerce features (feeds/ads). That’s fine for paid or product listings, but:
	•	don’t let the site become “store-first” from an SEO perspective
	•	ensure your core school pages are pages (service pages) and are internally linked strongly

⸻

If you want, I can make this even more exact (no guessing)

Send:
	1.	One example URL from the CLS “product” list
	2.	Search Console → Performance → Queries screenshot (3 months)

Then I’ll give you:
	•	exact WP Rocket exclusions to stop CLS
	•	exact Elementor section rules (min-height + image ratio)
	•	and your top “almost ranking” keywords with the exact pages to build for top 3.
